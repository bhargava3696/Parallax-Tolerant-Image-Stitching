#codes for Parallax-Tolerant Image Stitching Based on Robust Elastic Warping



Image stitching aims at generating high-quality panoramas with the lowest computational cost.A Parallax-Tolerant image stitching method based on robust elastic warping, which could achieve accurate alignment and efficient processing simultaneously.Given a group of point matches between images, an analytical warping function is constructed to eliminate the parallax errors. Then the input images are warped according to the computed deformations over the meshed image plane. The seamless panorama is composed by directly re-projecting the warped images.
